## What is an image ?
A image includes everthing a App needs to run (all files, and configuration settings):

## What is an Container ?
A container is like a virtual machine in the sense that provides a isolated environment to run our applications.
Can be stopped and restarted. Is just a OS process, but a special kind of process because it was is own File System.
