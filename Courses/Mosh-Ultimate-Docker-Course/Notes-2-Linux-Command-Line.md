## The Linux Command Line  
### Running Linux 
Let's start by running a docker container interactively : 
``` powershell
docker pull ubuntu 
# OR 
docker run ubuntu
# Like that will search for this image locally and if it does not find it
# will pull it from the internet
```
Them we have :
``` powershell
PS C:\Users\joaoc> docker pull ubuntu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
405f018f9d1d: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:b6b83d3c331794420340093eb706a6f152d9c1fa51b262d9bf34594887c2c7ac
Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest
```
When we do `docker run` the container just build, runs and shutsdown. So we need to build it interactively :
``` powershell
PS C:\Users\joaoc> docker run ubuntu
PS C:\Users\joaoc> docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
PS C:\Users\joaoc> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES

What is this `root@7e01079dc012:/#` ? 
This is called the __shell prompt__. A prompt in computer science is `a word or symbol on a screen to show that the system is waiting for input.`

What this `root@7e01079dc012:/#` stands for ? 
- root : the name of the current login user. The `root` user is the most priviliged user and is which we are log in by default.
- @ : just a separator :)
- 7e01079dc012 : Name of the machine. So the container was that ID that is generated by Docker Automatically. 
- / : (Where we are) We are in the highest directory of the file system inside the container
- '#' : It means i have all the priviligies. Instead of `#` i could have `$`, if log in was a normal user.

#### Q: 
##### Why the container just shutsdown when we do `docker run [image]` ?
Is like this by default, if we dont interact with it, it just shutsdown.

### Managing Packages 
In our days most of the times OS came with a `Package Manager`. For example : 
- npm
- apt
- nuget
- pim
- yarn

Linux is no different, and __it comes with `apt`__ .
`APT` makes use of a database in linux where is the references to possible packages that we need, and if they are installed or not : 
``` powershell
root@7e01079dc012:/# apt list
Listing... Done
adduser/now 3.118ubuntu5 all [installed,local]
apt/now 2.4.5 amd64 [installed,local]
base-files/now 12ubuntu4.1 amd64 [installed,local]
base-passwd/now 3.5.52build1 amd64 [installed,local]
bash/now 5.1-6ubuntu1 amd64 [installed,local]

dash/now 0.5.11+git20210903+057cd650a4ed-3build1 amd64 [installed,local]
debconf/now 1.5.79ubuntu1 all [installed,local]
debianutils/now 5.5-1ubuntu2 amd64 [installed,local]
diffutils/now 1:3.8-0ubuntu2 amd64 [installed,local]
dpkg/now 1.21.1ubuntu2.1 amd64 [installed,local]
e2fsprogs/now 1.46.5-2ubuntu1 amd64 [installed,local]
findutils/now 4.8.0-1ubuntu3 amd64 [installed,local]
gcc-12-base/now 12-20220319-1ubuntu1 amd64 [installed,l
```
In this case we does not have `nano` reference for instalation, so when i do this i get error: 
``` powershell
root@7e01079dc012:/# apt install nano
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Package nano is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'nano' has no installation candidate
```
So, i have to update the database with the packages first : 
``` powershell

#### Q : 
#### What if even with the update we dont get the reference in the database for instalation ?
